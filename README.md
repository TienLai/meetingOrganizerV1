**Key Features of the Meeting Organizer UI:**

Pre-meeting Planning Interface

Fields for meeting title, type, duration, number of attendees, and detailed agenda
Dropdown to categorize the meeting (based on our prior analysis of 60 meetings)
Simple form that collects the critical information needed for analysis


Real-time Meeting Analysis

Usefulness score calculation based on the same metrics we developed:

Agenda quality
Decision likelihood (based on meeting type history)
Expected engagement rate
Async possibility penalties
Meeting length penalties


Visual score gauges showing predicted usefulness and engagement
Detailed breakdown of score factors to help organizers understand what improves meeting value


Smart Recommendations

Tailored suggestions based on the calculated usefulness score
For low-scoring meetings, suggests asynchronous alternatives
For medium-scoring meetings, offers optimization tips
For high-scoring meetings, reinforces effective practices


Async Alternative Templates

When a meeting could be handled asynchronously, provides a ready-to-use template
Shows how the same information could be shared in an email or document format
Makes it easy to convert an unnecessary meeting into a more efficient format


Historical Meeting Data Integration

Shows average metrics for similar meeting types
Provides insights on decision rates, typical durations, and engagement patterns
Uses past meeting data to predict the likely outcomes of new meetings



This approach directly addresses the key issues we identified in the analysis:

65% of meetings could be handled asynchronously
Many meetings lack agendas, decisions, and sufficient engagement
The organizer can now see these issues before scheduling the meeting
